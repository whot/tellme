# NAME

tellme - text-to-speech command execution notifier

# SYNOPSIS

tellme [sudo] command [arg] [arg] ..

# DESCRIPTION

**tellme** runs the command and notify the user through text-to-speech when the
process finishes. In a default invocation, **tellme** notifies the user
whether the process finished successfully or with an error code. Depending
on the configuration options (see CONFIGURATION) **tellme** may also add
directory names, remove, add or substitute arguments.

tellme recognises the **sudo(8)** command and strips it from the voice output,
it is thus not necessary to run **tellme** itself as root.

# CONFIGURATION FILES

Configuration is supported through one or more configuration files. The
primary set of configuration files is in **XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tellme/\*.conf**.
These files are always loaded.

Per-directory overrides may be placed in **$PWD/.tellme/\*.conf**.
**tellme** runs upwards from the current working directory to locate a
**.tellme** configuration folder. On the first one found, the configuration
files are added to the list.

# CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES

Configuration directives are divided into a **[general]** section and
command-specific sections. These sections are named after the command, i.e.
for the **make** command the section is **[make]**.

directory=none
:    The directory included in the voice output. If unset or *none*, no
     directory is included. If *cwd*, the current directory's basename is
     added to the output. If *git*, **tellme** searches upwards for a
     directory containing a ".git" subdirectory. If found, that directory is
     added to the output, otherwise the current working directory is used.

dirsubs=/search/replace/ /search/replace/ :search:replace:
:    A space-separated list of search/replace patterns that modify the
     directory name. The first regex that matches is applied and processing
     stops. The field separator is the first and last character of the
     string and separates the search from the replace pattern.

blacklist=regex regex
:    A space-separated list of regular expressions. Any argument that matches
     any expression is dropped from the output.

whitelist=regex regex
:    A space-separated list of regular expressions. If set, any argument that
     matches any expression is added to the output, unless prohibited by the
     blacklist. Any argument that does not match any whitelisted argument is
     dropped.
